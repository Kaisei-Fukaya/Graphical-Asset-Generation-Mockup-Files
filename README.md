# Graphical Asset Generator Mockup Files
Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study.
In this repo you will find the files for the mockup interfaces that you will be testing.

It is recommended that you download these first, and follow the installation instructions before continuing.

## Installation instructions
### Stand-alone
The stand-alone interface can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Kaisei-Fukaya/Graphical-Asset-Generation-Mockup-Files/blob/09e65ee4ee42eac20d15d08e204103b491490e29/graphical-asset-generator_stand-alone-win32-x64.zip).

Once downloaded, extract the zip file in a location of your choosing such as your desktop. To run the application double click the {...exe} file. You may see a warning, click yes to run.

## Unity interfaces
The Unity interfaces come as a package. Ensure that you have a version of Unity 2020.3 or greater installed, as there are no guarantees this package will work with older versions. 


### Without Git
To install, create a new project and download the files from here:

Extract the "com.gagen.core" folder and place it within the "Packages" folder at the root of your project.

### With Git
Alternatively, if you have Git installed, open Unity and go to "Window > Package Manager" on the toolbar, from the package manager, click the plus icon and choose "Add package from git URL...". Then paste this URL into the search bar:
